Starter projects can be defined within this directory for development use. `example-starter` is the only directory
under version control. Any other starter projects you add will be ignored by Git.

Usage:
1. Add a directory with the appropriate site config file and templates under the `localdev/starters` directory.
2. Run the management command to load the starter projects into the database (`populate_local_starters`)
